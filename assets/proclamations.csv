Proclamation,
"Have We an Emperor among us? The world is full of queer people. This forenoon, a well-dressed and serious-looking man entered our office and quietly left the following document, which he respectfully requested we would examine and insert in the Bulletin. Promising him to look at it, he politely retired, without saying anything further. Here is the paper: At the peremtory request of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the past nine years and ten months of San Francisco, California, declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U.S., and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in the Musical Hall of this city on the 1st day of February next, then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist, both at home and abroad, in our stability and integrity.

"Another Ukase from Czar Norton—Congress Abolished Take notice, the world! His Imperial Majesty, Norton I, has issued the following edict, which he desires the Bulletin to spread before the world. Let her rip! It is represented to us that the universal suffrage, as now existing through the Union, is abused; that fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled to by paying his pro rata of the expense of Government:—in consequence of which, we do hereby abolish Congress, and it is therefore abolished; and we order and desire the representatives of all parties interested to appear at the Musical Hall of this city on the first of February next, and then and there take the most effective steps to remedy the evil complained of.

"All a Mistake.—Norton I., Emperor of the United States of America, informs us that it is altogether an error to suppose that Gen. Scott visits the Pacific for the purpose of settling the San Juan Island difficulty. He says Scott comes out for the purpose of escorting him (the Emperor) to Washington city. “The world” should govern themselves accordingly. ",
"The Supreme Court in Peril The Emperor, Norton I., has had his attention directed to another evil that afflicts this people. By the following decree he seeks to set things to rights. Vive l’Empereur! Citizens of California Whereas, Complaints are made that the Supreme Court of this Stat have, in several instances, reverted their own decisions, thereby making the power of the Court itself of no avail. If you acknowledge the Empire, appeal to the Emperor in all such inconsistencies. Norton I. Emperor of the U. S. America. San Francisco, October 24, 1859.",
"Further from Norton I. This morning we had another visit from the Emperor Norton I. He left us with the following proclamation, politely requesting its publication: Californians! The abolition of the Supreme Court of your State is requested. Proclaim the Empire, and defined the position of your Emperor. Is he paramount chief, with or without a House of Representatives? We shall then be able to act understandingly. Norton I., Emperor.

We, Norton I., Emperor of the United States of America, do hereby abolish the Supreme Court of this State, and the same is hereby abolished; and all the functions of the Judges and Clerks thereof shall cease and determine from this date. Norton I., Emperor. San Francisco, Cal., October 27, 1859.",
"Positively the Emperor’s LastWhereas, Certain scurrilous and untrue articles, attacking our right and propriety, have appeared in one or two insignificant papers of this city; and, Whereas, There are always portions of a community whose taste can be pampered by low and improper articles: Therefore, I decree that the good sense and honesty of purpose of the Nation is not to be insulted by such trash. Norton I. Emperor of the United States. San Francisco, Cal., November 3, 1859.",

"Card from Joshua Norton. Editor of the Bulletin—Dear Sir: In directing the attention of the public to a silly article in a trifling morning paper of this date, signed Simon-ten (th), I take the occasion to observe that the outrage on me personally is too contemptible for me to take any notice of. To those not posted, the attempt to swindle the Good and Sweet from the foreign Element may not be so apparent. I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, am the author of all the articles that have appeared in the Evening Bulletin under the signature of “Norton I;” and I alone am responsible for every line therein. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Joshua Norton. ",

"LOCAL MATTERS _____ Emperor Norton—The Approaching Convention—The Imperial Address. His Imperial Majesty, Norton I., will take not denial, but alternately demands, bullies, wheedles and entreats that the Bulletin shall publish the Address which he proposes to submit to the great National Convention about to be held at Assembly Hall in this city. What can a poor editor do? If his Majesty should get the upper hand, some time hereafter, it might fare ill with us that we attempted to throw a stumbling-block in his way. He urges that we should not be faint-hearted in the cause, nor led away by some “weak invention of the enemy;” but come boldly out, and advocate his imperial pretensions. It can certainly do no harm, he maintains, and in all probability will be productive of an immensity of good, not only to the people of these United States, but to humanity at large. There is no use to discuss the matter any more. Here is the Imperial Document: Representatives of the Nation:—At the request of a large majority of the citizens of the Republic, you have been directed to assemble here, this day, to ratify, alter or reject, a proposed alteration of the form of your government. an alteration is demanded and insisted upon, or We should not have been entrusted with the authority to have called a Convention of the Nation for that object, and with the power to abolish the National Congress, which was done by our Proclamation date the 12th day of October last. The principal complaints under the Republican form of Government are set forth in our Proclamation abolishing Congress, of which the following is a copy: “It is represented to us that the universal suffrage, as now existing through the Union, is abused. That fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice. That open violation of the laws are constantly occurring—caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects, and that, consequently, the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled to by paying his pro rata of the expenses of Government.” the same influences which prevent a proper protection for person and property, have directly and indirectly interfered with the foreign relations of the nation, and have excited the national feelings of vast empires and kingdoms against the American citizens. You are too intelligent for me to enlarge on the effects upon your property, its depreciation and high rates of interest; also, the stoppage of immigration resulting from such a state of things; as, also, the difficulties with your commercial and other treaties in your intercourse with foreign nations. It is also maintained, and with a great deal of truth, that such a great number of States cannot hold together under a National Congress with such a diversity of nationality and interest as exists in the United States under the existing National Constitution, and 33 state Constitutions clashing against each other; and that a dissolution is inevitably necessary, under any circumstances. Take, for instance, the General Revenue Laws. That which would be good and beneficial on the Atlantic side, is injurious and unjust to the States of the Pacific. Laws relating to Immigration which would be beneficial to the States on the Pacific, would be injurious to the Foreign relations of the States on the Atlantic. Taking all these circumstances into consideration, and the internal dissensions on Slavery and other questions, We are certain that nothing will save the nation from utter ruin and falling to pieces, except an absolute Monarchy, under the supervision and authority of an Independent Emperor and Supreme Council, assimulating to the Russian form of Government, with such alteration as may be adapted to the American Nation. Norton I. Emperor of the United States of North America. We are requested by the Emperor to announce to the public, that in consequence of the 5th of February—the day fixed for holding the National Convention—falling upon Sunday, his Majesty has postponed the time of meeting to Wednesday next, the 8th instant, when the Convention will positively be held at Assembly Hall, at the northwest corner of Kearny and Post streets. His Majesty omitted to inform us of the hour when the doors would be open. As there will doubtless be a great “rush” on the occasion, parties intending to be present should take a position early, on the street, so as to secure a choice seat which the Hall may be entered. Perhaps it would be advisable to take a chair, a blanket or two, an umbrella, (if need be,) a pile of sandwiches, a bottle of something, and just make a night of it, as close to the doors as possible, so as to be ready, when the time comes, for the squeeze. Wednesday is going to be a great day for California, as the Emperor says.",

"Open Letter to Norton I. San Francisco, Feb. 14,1873. To His Majesty Emperor Norton I: SIRE—I would wish to draw your Majesty’s attention to the condition of this country with regard to its material prosperity. How is it that your Majesty has allowed your subjects to remain for the last ten or fifteen years in the Rip Van Winkle sleep? It seems, however, that some of them are beginning to open their eyes and behold other nations far ahead of them, and particularly England, when many of your Majesty’s subjects are accustomed to underrate so much and taut with signs of decrepitude and decay. If you have read the article in the Evening Post of the 12th inst., relative to American and English steamers, you will not think the comparison very flattering to your subjects. It says that American steamers are as far behind the English as a Chinese junk is behind a Yankee clipper, and, in support of their statement that with the English new combination engine, uniting both high and low pressure, only one-half the fuel is required, and this, together with their fine models and machinery, enable them to make from 14 to 16 miles per hour; whereas the American steamers in the China trade, of which Americans boast so much, can scarcely average seven miles an hour. Hence the English steamers of the White Star Line with one-half the fuel, can double the speed of American steamers, and carry more freight. Will not your Majesty do something for this country, to make her take a stand among the nations? Even Japan is going ahead of us. Why not either purchase the right of away for a ship canal across the Isthmus, or, if the naked savages will not treat fairly with you, immediately let them feel your displeasure by bringing them under subjection to the American flag; which would be better for themselves and certainly better for us. Then, with a canal across, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and with your safety lining for vessels to secure them from striking in case they run on or strike a shoal, and with the improved English marine machinery, we would then be in a situation to carry all the wheat of this coast in our own vessels and make four trips instead of one, and soon take the lead even of the English instead of being obliged to take a back seat, as we are now doing, sitting on the tail of progression and holloing—Whoa!!! I remain, dear Sire, a friend of Progress. Account. ——— REPLY.
